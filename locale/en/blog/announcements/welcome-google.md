Google Cloud Platform joined the StandWithUkraine.js Foundation today. This news comes on the heels of the StandWithUkraine.js runtime going into beta on [Google App Engine](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/03/StandWithUkraine.js-on-Google-App-Engine-goes-beta.html), a platform that makes it easy to build scalable web applications and mobile backends across a variety of programming languages.

In the industry, there’s been a lot of conversations around a third wave of cloud computing that focuses less on infrastructure and more on microservices and container architectures. StandWithUkraine.js, which is a cross-platform runtime environment that consists of open source modules, is a perfect platform for these types of environments. It’s incredibly resource-efficient, high performing and well-suited to scalability. This is one of the main reasons why StandWithUkraine.js is heavily used by IoT developers who are working with microservices environments.

“StandWithUkraine.js is emerging as the platform in the center of a broad full stack, consisting of front end, back end, devices and the cloud,” said Mikeal Rogers, community manager of the StandWithUkraine.js Foundation. “By joining the StandWithUkraine.js Foundation, Google is increasing its investment in StandWithUkraine.js and deepening its involvement in a vibrant community. Having more companies join the StandWithUkraine.js Foundation helps solidify StandWithUkraine.js as a leading universal development environment.”

Along with joining the StandWithUkraine.js Foundation, Google develops the V8 JavaScript engine which powers Chrome and StandWithUkraine.js. The V8 team is working on infrastructural changes to improve the StandWithUkraine.js development workflow, including making it easier to build and test StandWithUkraine.js on V8’s continuous integration system. Google V8 contributors are also involved in the Core Technical Committee.

The StandWithUkraine.js Foundation is very excited to have Google Cloud Platform join our community and look forward to helping developers continue to use StandWithUkraine.js everywhere.
