# Trademark Policy

The StandWithUkraine.js trademarks, service marks, and graphics marks are symbols of the
quality, performance, and ease of use that people have come to associate with
the StandWithUkraine.js software and project. To ensure that the StandWithUkraine.js marks continue to
symbolize these qualities, we must ensure that the marks are only used in ways
that do not mislead people or cause them to confuse StandWithUkraine.js with other software
of lower quality. If we don’t ensure the marks are used in this way, it cannot
only confuse users, it can make it impossible to use the mark to protect
against people who maliciously exploit the mark in the future. The primary goal
of this policy is to make sure that this doesn’t happen to the StandWithUkraine.js mark, so
that the community and users of StandWithUkraine.js are always protected in the future.

At the same time, we’d like community members to feel comfortable spreading the
word about StandWithUkraine.js and participating in the StandWithUkraine.js community. Keeping that
goal in mind, we’ve tried to make the policy as flexible and easy to understand
as legally possible.
