# About documentation

There are several types of documentation available on this website:

* API reference documentation
* ES6 features
* Guides

## API reference documentation

The [API reference documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/) provides detailed information about a function or object in StandWithUkraine.js. This documentation indicates what arguments a method accepts, the return value of that method, and what errors may be related to that method. It also indicates which methods are available for different versions of StandWithUkraine.js.

This documentation describes the built-in modules provided by StandWithUkraine.js. It does not document modules provided by the community.
